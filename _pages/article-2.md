The non-commercial raising of crops, keeping of gardens, orchards, indoor hydroponics/aquaponics, forestry (including tree farms), and maple sugaring are not regulated by this Ordinance except as provided in Article IV, Section 401 and Section 410. Greenhouses, sugar shacks, and other such *accessory buildings* to these activities are subject to all applicable regulations of this Ordinance.



## Section 201 – Yard requirements

Except as otherwise provided herein, no building or structure other than accessory structures and buildings of 130 sq. ft. or less per Section 201.8 below shall occupy any part of any yard required by Article III, except that architectural details may extend not more than two (2) feet into any required yard.

### 201.1 Reduction for an average front yard

The required front yard may be reduced to the average front yard of the existing buildings on the same side of the street in the same block, provided that there are at least two (2) such buildings and provided that all such buildings are within 300 feet of the premises (as measured along the street line). This reduction shall not be allowed for lots fronting on a state highway.

### 201.2 Reserved

### 201.3 Lots on more than one street

A lot adjoining two streets shall have a minimum front yard on each street and minimum side yards on the remaining sides. A lot adjoining three streets shall have minimum front yards on at least two intersecting streets, a minimum rear yard on the other street and a side yard on the remaining side.

### 201.4 Fences, hedges, and walls

Fences, hedges, and walls may be located within the minimum required yards, but if located within the required front yards, they shall not exceed 3 ½ feet in height unless set back at least 15 feet from the right-of-way. The Board of Adjustment, as a special exception, may allow fences, hedges, and walls of a greater height. This section shall not apply to fences and walls erected for agricultural (e.g., the confinement of animals), safety, or security purposes in the industrial, commercial, or rural land districts.

Fences, hedges, and walls not in conformance with this section shall be discontinued.

*Note: Section 603.2 of the July 19, 1978 Zoning Ordinance provided that non-complying fences, hedges and walls be discontinued by July 18, 1983.*

### 201.5 Flagpoles

Flagpoles may occupy required yards.

### 201.6 Antennae, satellite dishes, etc.

Radio, TV and communications antennae, satellite dishes and the like shall not occupy the areas of front yards or required side and rear yards; provided, however, that this restriction may be relaxed by special exception, if the Board of Adjustment finds, in addition to the standards set forth in Section 801.3, that such a relaxation is required by applicable federal regulations and RSA 674:16, IV, in order to reasonably accommodate such facilities.

### 201.7 Driveways and parking areas

Driveways may occupy required yard areas. Parking areas may occupy required yard areas provided they maintain at least a 5 ft. setback from all lot lines, except that (i) parking areas in the front yard are prohibited in the LD District per Section 307.9.B, and (ii) for all uses other than one- and two-family dwellings for which a portion of the driveway occupies the required front yard, parking areas in the front yard in the residential districts, the R-O District, and the R-O-1 District, shall be set back no less than the lesser of the minimum front yard requirement or the front building line, but in no case less than five (5) feet.

### 201.8 Accessory structures and buildings of 130 square feet or less

One-story detached accessory structures and buildings of 130 sq. ft. or less and not exceeding twelve (12) feet in height may be located within the minimum required side and rear yards, in all zoning districts, provided they are placed a minimum of 5 feet from the side and rear property lines. A zoning permit shall be required for an accessory building.

### 201.9 Accessory renewable energy systems

Accessory renewable energy systems shall not occupy the areas of required front, side and rear yards (a.k.a. required setbacks), except as allowed by Section 612.


## Section 202 – Reduction of lot area or dimensions

The configuration of a lot shall not be altered so that the area, yards, lot width, frontage, coverage or other requirements of this Ordinance are less than the minimums required herein. This requirement shall not apply when part of a lot is taken for a public purpose.

## Section 203 – Height requirements

### 203.1 Height exceptions

Except as provided in Section 407 for structures near the airport or in the airport approach zone, the following structures may exceed the maximum height limitations of Article III by not more than 20 percent:  
<ol type="A">
<li>Flagpoles.</li>  
<li>Rooftop features including chimneys, spires, towers, lightning rods, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment, elevator shafts, accessory solar energy facilities or similar structures/equipment.</li>
<li>Radio or TV antennae or satellite dish for private, non-commercial reception.</li>
<li>Accessory wind energy facilities, except as provided in Section 203.3.</li>
<li>Silos, except that the Board of Adjustment may allow a greater height for silos in the RL Districts by special exception granted pursuant to Section 801.3.</li>
</ol>
### 203.2 Commercial television or radio broadcast station antennas and towers

Commercial television or radio broadcast station antennas or towers allowed by *special exception* in RL Districts shall be exempt from the maximum height limits of Section 312, Section 313 and Section 314, except as provided in Section 407; provided, however, that in addition to the findings required by Section 801.3, the Board of Adjustment shall also find:
<ol type="A">
<li>That the proposed height of the antenna and associated structures such as towers is the minimum height permitted by federal regulations for the frequency and type of broadcast signal to be used by the applicant, in light of best available technology, and that no additional height is being sought solely to increase the range of the signal; and </li> 
<li>That there are no feasible alternative sites within the RL Districts of the City where the facility could be located with significantly less visual impact on the neighborhood and City as a whole, due to reduced height needs, reduced visibility, or other site advantages.</li>
</ol>
To show that these standards are met, the applicant shall furnish the Board with a written impact analysis prepared by a professional radio frequency engineer familiar with both the technology and the regulatory framework for the type of station proposed. The analysis shall not be conclusive, but shall detail the applicant’s specific objectives, and shall evaluate and compare specific alternative technologies, and the suitability and visual impacts of specific alternative sites within the City, using viewshed maps and photo simulations. The Board of Adjustment may, at the applicant’s expense, hire a person, with such qualifications as the Board may determine, to review the analysis. The Board may require additional information as needed to decide the case.

### 203.3 Rooftop structures

Elevator enclosures, stairways, tanks, HVAC equipment, spires, cupolas, and similar structures and mechanical appurtenances may be erected above the height limits prescribed, provided they are set back from the edge of the roof a distance equal to their height above the roof, and provided further that the aggregate area of all such structures does not exceed 25 percent of the roof area.


## Section 204 – Lots in two zoning districts

Where a district boundary line divides a lot of record, the regulations applicable to the less restricted portion of such lot may, at the owner's option, extend not more than 30 feet into the more restricted portion, provided the lot has frontage on a street in the less restricted district.


## Section 205 – One principal structure per residential lot

No more than one principal structure intended for residential occupancy shall be placed on any one lot, except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance.


## Section 206 – Sight distance at street and driveway intersections

There shall be no obstruction to vision between the heights of three (3) feet and ten (10) feet above the street surface within any triangular area formed by the intersection of two street lines and a third line joining them at points 25 feet away from their intersection, or by the intersection of a driveway and a street line and a third line joining them at points 25 feet away from their intersection. The Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception to this requirement, pursuant to Section 801.3, in the commercial and industrial districts only.


## Section 207 – Yard sales

A yard sale from any one location shall not be considered a use regulated under this Ordinance, providing that it does not occur more than twice within any calendar year for a period of not more than two consecutive days each and does not contain items purchased expressly for such sale. Any such type of sale exceeding these limits shall conform to the provisions of this Ordinance and shall require a zoning permit.
